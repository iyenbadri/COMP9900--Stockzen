* Notes *

- For team meetings we had over the project, i.e. regular standups / weekly big meeting / 
  demo prep / retro / etc., I attended them all except for one standup in 29/10 that I 
  replaced with text update
- As I took part in frontend developement although I was beginner in that area, had to
  put much time and efforts in learning whole languages from the scratch, which sadly led 
  to way less code contribution. However, thanks to supportive team members, I could have
  great opportunity to learn new things and keep it up. 
  Nice team, valuable project experience!
