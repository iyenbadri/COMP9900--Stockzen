Technical obstacle: Design and Storyboard
While we initially wanted to go with a Balsamiq/Figma combo, Figma-only seemed to be a much better/ hi res option for wireframing, as it also provided a real life example for frontend devs to work on.
I drafted up colour palette, font, and Figma designs; chose the project name and logo design. 
Held a 1-hr design meeting with Gunjan to figure out the page flow.
I continued design of pages in Figma, completing design of Landing, Login/Register, Home, Portfolio, Stock Page and other minor functionailites. I created an SVG image for the StockZen logo.

I updated all sprint dates on Jira and reviewed all project objectives and made adjustments to user stories

Meeting 3: Separate meeting with Badri to catch up on designs and wireframes.
