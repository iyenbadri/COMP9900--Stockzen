Week 1

I registered my Atlassian account, linked my GitHub account. I posted in the Team forum
that Iâ€™m seeking for a team.

We formed a team in week 1 lab session. We decided to work on the stock portfolio
project and we book a next meeting to be 19 Sunday on what to do in the proposal.
We appoint Khai as our team Scruum master as he has some experience on the method.

Week 2

I worked with Khai to finalise the objectives and user stories. We also decided to use
Slack as a communication tool and Team as a meeting platform.

In the lab session, we ask some questions about the objective. After that we talk about
how to implement the project.

For the proposla, I and Khai were working on the objectives/user stories part. Jee was
working on the Use case and Artitechture diagram. Ban was working on the design and
wireframe. Gun was working on the backgroud.
