===========================================
Week 1

I registered my Atlassian account, linked my GitHub account. I posted in the Team forum
that I was seeking for a team.

We formed a team in week 1 lab session. We decided to work on the stock portfolio
project and we scheduled our next meeting to be 19 Sunday on what to do in the proposal.
We appointed Khai as our team Scruum master as he has some experience on the method.

============================================
Week 2

I worked with Khai to finalise the objectives and user stories. We also decided to use
Slack as a communication tool and Team as a meeting platform.

In the lab session, we ask some questions about the objective. After that we talk about
how to implement the project.

For the proposal, I and Khai were working on the objectives/user stories part. Jeehyun
was working on the Use case and Artitechture diagram. Badri was working on the design
and wireframe. Gunjan was working on the backgroud.

Khai also supplied us with design of screens on Figma. The url is

============================================
Week 3

On Sunday, we had a stand-up meeting which we told what have we done, what will we do
and what's blocking us. Later that day I worked with Khai to assign a story point in
all storis.

I started implement the UI part including registration, login, logout. I and Khai worked
together to setup the environment for development and for a smoothe experience. 

We agreed to use pull request to review code before merge changes into main branch.

We agree to finalise the proposal on Thurday, I took a look a gave some comments.

I finished implement the UI of the user registration page along with the user registration
success page. I customised the colors in Bootstrap to match out selected colors
(https://coolors.co/0b132b-1c2541-3a506b-5bc0be-c2fff6).

I have a discussion with Khai that we have to find a way to query data from AlphaVantage
because there are limits on how many requests could be made in a period of time.

After I finished some of the task, I requested a pull request to Jeehyun and Khai.
The easy one I requested a review from Jeehyun and the complex one I requested a review
from Khai.

We had assign each member a user story to officially start our development process. I
chose to work on the user registration story. Khai chose a responsive design story.
Jeehyun chose the user login story. Gunjan chose the portfolio creation story. And
Badrivishal chose portfolio rename/delete story.

As there are so many tools used, I encountered a problem of too many tools to keep track.
I will find a way to reduce the problem.

- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not
