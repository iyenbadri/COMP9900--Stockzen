Week 1

I registered my Atlassian account, linked my GitHub account. I posted in the Team forum
that Iâ€™m seeking for a team.

We formed a team in week 1 lab session. We decided to work on the stock portfolio
project and we book a next meeting to be 19 Sunday on what to do in the proposal.
We appoint Khai as our team Scruum master as he has some experience on the method.

============================================
Week 2

I worked with Khai to finalise the objectives and user stories. We also decided to use
Slack as a communication tool and Team as a meeting platform.

In the lab session, we ask some questions about the objective. After that we talk about
how to implement the project.

For the proposla, I and Khai were working on the objectives/user stories part. Jee was
working on the Use case and Artitechture diagram. Ban was working on the design and
wireframe. Gun was working on the backgroud.


============================================
Week 3

On Sunday, we had a stand-up meeting which we told what have we done, what will we do
and what's blocking us. Later that day I worked with Khai to assign a story point in
all storis.

I started implement the UI part including registration, login, logout. I and Khai worked
together to setup the environment for development and for a smoothe experience. 

We agreed to use pull request to review code before merge changes into main branch.

We agree to finalise the proposal on Thurday, I took a look a gave some comments.

I finished implement the UI of the user registration page along with the user registration
success page. I customised the colors in Bootstrap to match out selected colors
(https://coolors.co/0b132b-1c2541-3a506b-5bc0be-c2fff6).

I have a discussion with Khai that we have to find a way to query data from AlphaVantage
because there are limits on how many requests could be made in a period of time.

We had assign each member a user story to officially start our development process. I
chose to work on the user registration story. Khai chose a responsive design story.
Jeehyun chose the user login story. Gunjan chose the portfolio creation story. And
Badrivishal chose portfolio rename/delete story.

As there are so many tools used, I encountered a problem of too many tools to keep track.
I will find a way to reduce the problem.
